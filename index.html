            Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American
            comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to
            become Marvel Comics' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division
            of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics industry.

            In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he
            co-created numerous popular fictional characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man,
            Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and
            Ant-Man. The superheroes he created seemed more meaningful and realistic.[2] In doing so, he pioneered a
            more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he challenged the
            restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he
            pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results. Following his retirement
            from Marvel in the 1990s, he remained a public figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo
            appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel characters, on which he received an executive
            producer credit. Meanwhile, he continued independent creative ventures into his 90s, until his death in
            2018.

            Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby
            Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.

        <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
        <h3>1. HIS WIFE WAS ALSO HIS BARBER.</h3>
        <p>As a bit of a throwaway fact, Stanley Martin Lieber (Stan Lee) revealed the secret of his slicked back
            mane on the second page of his memoir. “My whole adult life, I’ve never been to a barber,” he wrote.
            “Joanie always cuts my hair.”</p>
        <h3>2. HIS CONFIDENCE CAME FROM HIS MOTHER.</h3>
        <p>Lee wrote that as a child he loved to read books by Mark Twain, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne,
            H.G. Wells, and others, and his mother often watched him read: “I probably got my self-confidence from
            the fact that my mother thought everything I did was brilliant.”</p>
        <h3>3. YOUNG STAN LEE WROTE OBITUARIES.</h3>
        <p>Before writing about the fantastic lives of fictional characters, Lee wrote antemortem obituaries for
            celebrities at an undisclosed news office in New York. He said that he eventually quit that job because
            it was too “depressing.”</p>
        <h3>4. CAPTAIN AMERICA WAS HIS FIRST BIG BREAK.</h3>
        <p>A week into his job at Timely Comics, Lee got the opportunity to write a two-page Captain America comic.
            He wrote it under the pen name Stan Lee (which became his legal name) and titled it "Captain America
            Foils the Traitor’s Revenge." His first full comic script would come in Captain America Issue 5,
            published August 1, 1941.</p>
        <h3>5. HE WROTE TRAINING FILMS FOR THE ARMY WITH DR. SEUSS.</h3>
        <p>After being transferred from the army’s Signal Corps in New Jersey, Lee worked as a playwright in the
            Training Film Division in Queens with eight other men, including a few who went on to be very famous:
            Pulitzer Prize-winning author William Saroyan, cartoonist Charles Addams (creator of The Addams Family),
            director Frank Capra (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington [1939] and It’s a Wonderful Life [1946]) and Theodor
            Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss.</p>
        <h3>6. HE DEFIED THE COMICS CODE AUTHORITY WITH AN ANTI-DRUG COMIC.</h3>
        <p>In 1971, Lee received a letter from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asking him to put
            an anti-drug message in one of his books. He came up with a Spider-Man story that involved his best
            friend Harry abusing pills because of a break-up. The CCA would not approve the story with their seal
            because of the mention of drugs, but Lee convinced his publisher, Martin Goodman, to run the comic
            anyway.</p>
        <h3>7. AN ISSUE AT THE PRINTERS TURNED THE HULK GREEN.</h3>
        <p>The character was supposed to be gray, but according to Lee, the printer had a hard time keeping the
            color consistent. “So as of issue #2,” Lee wrote, “with no explanation, he turned green.”</p>
        <h3>8. HIS WIFE DESTROYED HIS PRIZED TYPEWRITER.</h3>
        <p>According to Lee, during an argument, Joanie destroyed the typewriter he used to write the first issues
            for characters including Spider-Man and The Fantastic Four. “This happened before eBay," he wrote. "Too
            bad. I could’ve auctioned the parts and made a mint.”</p>
        <h3>9. A FIRE DESTROYED HIS INTERVIEWS AND LECTURES.</h3>
        <p>When Lee moved his family to Los Angeles, he set up a studio in Van Nuys where he stored videotapes of
            his talks and interviews, along with a commissioned bust of his wife. The building was lost to a blaze
            that the fire department believed was arson, but no one was ever charged with the crime.</p>
        <h3>10. HIS FAVORITE MARVEL FILM CAMEO WAS BASED ON ONE FROM THE COMICS.</h3>
        <p>Beginning with the first Spider-Man film in 2002, Stan Lee has made quick cameos in Marvel films as a
            service to the fans. He said that his appearance in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) was
            inspired by the story of Reed and Sue Richards’ wedding in Fantastic Four Annual Volume 1 #3, in which
            he and artist/writer Jack Kirby attempt to crash the ceremony but are thwarted.</p>
