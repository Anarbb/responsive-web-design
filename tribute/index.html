      <p>
        Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922 –
        November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher,
        and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to
        become Marvel Comics' primary creative leader for two decades, leading
        its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a
        multimedia corporation that dominated the comics industry. In
        collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists Jack
        Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created numerous popular fictional
        characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor,
        the Hulk, Black Widow, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil,
        Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man. The superheroes he created
        seemed more meaningful and realistic.[2] In doing so, he pioneered a
        more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and
        in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code
        Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s
        he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with
        mixed results. Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, he
        remained a public figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo
        appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel characters, on
        which he received an executive producer credit. Meanwhile, he continued
        independent creative ventures into his 90s, until his death in 2018. Lee
        was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of
        Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the
        NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.

      <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
      <h3>1. HIS WIFE WAS ALSO HIS BARBER.</h3>
      <p>
        As a bit of a throwaway fact, Stanley Martin Lieber (Stan Lee) revealed
        the secret of his slicked back mane on the second page of his memoir.
        “My whole adult life, I’ve never been to a barber,” he wrote. “Joanie
        always cuts my hair.”
      </p>
      <h3>2. HIS CONFIDENCE CAME FROM HIS MOTHER.</h3>
      <p>
        Lee wrote that as a child he loved to read books by Mark Twain, Sir
        Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and others, and his mother
        often watched him read: “I probably got my self-confidence from the fact
        that my mother thought everything I did was brilliant.”
      </p>
      <h3>3. YOUNG STAN LEE WROTE OBITUARIES.</h3>
      <p>
        Before writing about the fantastic lives of fictional characters, Lee
        wrote antemortem obituaries for celebrities at an undisclosed news
        office in New York. He said that he eventually quit that job because it
        was too “depressing.”
      </p>
      <h3>4. CAPTAIN AMERICA WAS HIS FIRST BIG BREAK.</h3>
      <p>
        A week into his job at Timely Comics, Lee got the opportunity to write a
        two-page Captain America comic. He wrote it under the pen name Stan Lee
        (which became his legal name) and titled it "Captain America Foils the
        Traitor’s Revenge." His first full comic script would come in Captain
        America Issue 5, published August 1, 1941.
      </p>
      <h3>5. HE WROTE TRAINING FILMS FOR THE ARMY WITH DR. SEUSS.</h3>
      <p>
        After being transferred from the army’s Signal Corps in New Jersey, Lee
        worked as a playwright in the Training Film Division in Queens with
        eight other men, including a few who went on to be very famous: Pulitzer
        Prize-winning author William Saroyan, cartoonist Charles Addams (creator
        of The Addams Family), director Frank Capra (Mr. Smith Goes to
        Washington [1939] and It’s a Wonderful Life [1946]) and Theodor Geisel,
        better known as Dr. Seuss.
      </p>
      <h3>6. HE DEFIED THE COMICS CODE AUTHORITY WITH AN ANTI-DRUG COMIC.</h3>
      <p>
        In 1971, Lee received a letter from the Department of Health, Education,
        and Welfare asking him to put an anti-drug message in one of his books.
        He came up with a Spider-Man story that involved his best friend Harry
        abusing pills because of a break-up. The CCA would not approve the story
        with their seal because of the mention of drugs, but Lee convinced his
        publisher, Martin Goodman, to run the comic anyway.
      </p>
      <h3>7. AN ISSUE AT THE PRINTERS TURNED THE HULK GREEN.</h3>
      <p>
        The character was supposed to be gray, but according to Lee, the printer
        had a hard time keeping the color consistent. “So as of issue #2,” Lee
        wrote, “with no explanation, he turned green.”
      </p>
      <h3>8. HIS WIFE DESTROYED HIS PRIZED TYPEWRITER.</h3>
      <p>
        According to Lee, during an argument, Joanie destroyed the typewriter he
        used to write the first issues for characters including Spider-Man and
        The Fantastic Four. “This happened before eBay," he wrote. "Too bad. I
        could’ve auctioned the parts and made a mint.”
      </p>
      <h3>9. A FIRE DESTROYED HIS INTERVIEWS AND LECTURES.</h3>
      <p>
        When Lee moved his family to Los Angeles, he set up a studio in Van Nuys
        where he stored videotapes of his talks and interviews, along with a
        commissioned bust of his wife. The building was lost to a blaze that the
        fire department believed was arson, but no one was ever charged with the
        crime.
      </p>
      <h3>
        10. HIS FAVORITE MARVEL FILM CAMEO WAS BASED ON ONE FROM THE COMICS.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Beginning with the first Spider-Man film in 2002, Stan Lee has made
        quick cameos in Marvel films as a service to the fans. He said that his
        appearance in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) was
        inspired by the story of Reed and Sue Richards’ wedding in Fantastic
        Four Annual Volume 1 #3, in which he and artist/writer Jack Kirby
        attempt to crash the ceremony but are thwarted.
