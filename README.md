# Responsive Web Design


In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages 
that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a 
penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen 
sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.
